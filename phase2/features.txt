todo features
=======
- facebook share btn
- try increasing session load speed 
- Searchbar that waits for the user to finish typing, only search through images in preexisting query 
- Use some sort of api?
- increase visual appearance 
- MAT Design - Checkboxes for tags, tableview for tag view
- only set tags if ImageFile's file attribute changes. (To replicate problem, try adding tag that results in a filename
that exists in database. then save a new name... Filename will be new given name but tag will not be added but will still
show as added)
- update code to use TagManager through StateManager and serialize TagManager instead of just tagmanager arraylist
- We should implement logic that handles what happens when the user deletes a tag... ask them if they wan't to remove the
tag from all their images.
- import facebook friends as tags?
- organize dependencies 
- go over project handout + announcments and do everything
- process videos?
