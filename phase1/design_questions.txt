# Phase 1 Design Questions

Which part(s) of the program are responsible for reading the contents of the
starting directory?
activities/HomeScreenViewController to prompt the user for a new directory. 
managers/ImageFileOperationsManager to request fetching images and processing them 
utils/FileOperations to fetch and return files when ImageFileOperationsManager requests it. 

What happens when a new tag is created?
Tag creation occurs in the TagScreenViewController. The controller takes input from the user via the textfield and calls the Tag constructor to create a tag with the same name. 
Then the tag is added to the TagManager's static list which keeps track of all the tags in the system. 

Which class is keeping track of the association between tags and files?
The classes ImageFile and ImageFileOperationsManager keeps track of the association between tags and files. Each ImageFile object stores the file as an attribute of type File as well as the tags which are stored in an ArrayList of tags. Each time a tag is added to the ImageFile object, the ImageFileOperationsManager is called statically to rename the object to include the new tags.
